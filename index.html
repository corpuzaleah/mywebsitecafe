Cafés have been established as staples of society in industrialized nations throughout the world. While many may overlook the impact of the café on society, there is no doubt that its contributions have been large. Patrons frequent coffee shops, making a stop at the local Starbucks part of their daily routine. Cafés offer a pick-me-up before work, a reward after a long day, a stimulating environment for creativity and thought, or simply a place to relax and spend time with friends. A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee, related coffee drinks (latte, cappuccino, espresso), and – depending on country – other drinks including alcoholic. Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks such as iced coffee and iced tea; in continental Europe cafés serve alcoholic drinks. A coffeehouse may also serve some type of food, such as light snacks, sandwiches muffins or other pastries.</p>
